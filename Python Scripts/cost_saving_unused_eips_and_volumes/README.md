
# AWS Cost-Saving Report Script

This Python script helps identify unused Elastic IPs and unattached EBS volumes in a specified AWS region. By identifying these resources, you can reduce costs by releasing resources that aren't currently in use.

## Features

- **Check for Unused Elastic IPs**: Identifies Elastic IPs that are allocated but not associated with any instances or network interfaces.
- **Check for Unattached EBS Volumes**: Finds EBS volumes that are in an "available" state (unattached) and thus may be suitable for deletion or other cost-saving actions.
- **Formatted Report**: Generates a clear, well-formatted report with all findings, ready for review or distribution.
- **Cost-Saving Insights**: Helps in AWS cost optimization by identifying unused resources.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Credentials**: Ensure that you have AWS credentials set up in your environment. You can do this using the AWS CLI or by setting up environment variables.
- **boto3 Library**: This script requires the `boto3` library, AWSâ€™s SDK for Python.

  Install `boto3` with:
  ```bash
  pip install boto3
  ```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository** (or download the script file directly):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python aws_cost_saving_report.py
   ```

   By default, the script checks for unused resources in the `eu-west-2` region. To specify a different region, modify the `region` variable in the script:

   ```python
   region = 'your-region-here'
   ```

3. **Output**:
   - The script will print a formatted report to the console.
   - It will also save the report to a file named `aws_cost_saving_report.txt` in the current directory.

### Example Report

Below is an example output from the report generated by the script:

```
==================================================
 Cost Saving Report for AWS Region: eu-west-2 
Generated on: 2024-11-05 15:30:00
==================================================

ðŸ”¹ Unused Elastic IPs:
--------------------------------------------------
  - Public IP: 18.169.179.246
    Allocation ID: eipalloc-0a16ce6a6f3df9206
    Domain: vpc

--------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Unattached EBS Volumes:
--------------------------------------------------
  - Volume ID: vol-0bb33f879ca335c35
    Size: 1 GiB
    Availability Zone: eu-west-2a
    Volume Type: gp3
    Created At: 2024-11-04 20:52:04.942000+00:00

--------------------------------------------------
```

## Customization

You can easily customize the script to include other AWS regions, filter by additional parameters, or even send the report as an email or store it in an S3 bucket.

## Potential Cost Savings

- **Unused Elastic IPs**: Amazon charges for Elastic IPs not associated with any running instance. Releasing these IPs helps reduce costs.
- **Unattached EBS Volumes**: EBS volumes accrue charges even when not attached to an instance. Deleting these unattached volumes helps in reducing unnecessary expenses.

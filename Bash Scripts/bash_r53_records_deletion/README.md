# AWS Route53 Record Management Scripts

This repository contains two Bash scripts for managing DNS records in AWS Route53. The scripts are designed to help you identify, update, and delete DNS records based on specific prefixes and types.

## Overview

The provided scripts perform the following tasks:

1. **Identify and list DNS records** that match specific prefixes and types (A and TXT records) in a specified Route53 hosted zone.
2. **Update the identified records** with dummy data, which is required to delete them in AWS Route53 due to the way AWS handles record deletions.
3. **Delete the identified records** from the hosted zone.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with permissions to access Route53.
- AWS CLI installed and configured on your local machine.
- `jq` installed for processing JSON data in scripts.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git
   cd repo
   ```

2. Open the scripts in a text editor and update the `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` variable in both scripts with your actual Route53 hosted zone ID.

3. Make sure the scripts have execute permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x script1.sh script2.sh
   ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Identify Records

Run the first script to identify records:

```bash
./script1.sh
```

This script will create a file named `route53_records_to_delete.txt`, containing the records matching the specified prefixes and types.

### Step 2: Delete Records

Run the second script to update and delete the identified records:

```bash
./script2.sh
```

This script will read the records from `route53_records_to_delete.txt`, update them with dummy values, and then delete them from the hosted zone.

## Scripts Explanation

### `script1.sh`

- Fetches all DNS records from the specified Route53 hosted zone.
- Filters the records based on specified prefixes and types (A and TXT).
- Outputs matching records to `route53_records_to_delete.txt`.

### `script2.sh`

- Reads records from `route53_records_to_delete.txt`.
- For each record, it first updates it with dummy data (either `0.0.0.0` for A records or `\"0.0.0.0\"` for TXT records).
- Deletes the record from Route53.

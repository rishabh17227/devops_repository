# Terraform Infrastructure Management

This repository contains Terraform configurations for managing AWS resources. The provided Makefile simplifies the workflow for planning, applying, and destroying infrastructure across different environments.

## Overview

Terraform workspaces allow you to manage multiple environments (like `dev`, `test`, `prod`, etc.) within a single configuration. This README explains how to create and switch between workspaces, and how to use the provided Makefile for Terraform operations.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
- AWS credentials configured. The `profile` specified in the `env_vars/<env>.tfvars` file should exist in your AWS configuration.
- Familiarity with the command line.

## Directory Structure

```
.
├── env_vars
│   ├── rishabh.tfvars
│   ├── lakshay.tfvars
│   └── skp.tfvars
├── Makefile
└── main.tf
```

### Environment Variable Files

Each file in the `env_vars` directory contains environment-specific variables. For example:
- **rishabh.tfvars**
- **lakshay.tfvars**
- **skp.tfvars**

These files define variables like `aws_account_id`, `aws_region`, and `profile` used in the Terraform configuration.

## Workspace Creation and Management

### Creating a New Workspace

To create a new Terraform workspace, use the following command:

```bash
terraform workspace new <workspace_name>
```

For example, to create workspaces named `rishabh` and `lakshay`, you would run:

```bash
terraform workspace new rishabh
terraform workspace new lakshay
```

### Switching Between Workspaces

You can switch between existing workspaces using:

```bash
terraform workspace select <workspace_name>
```

For example:

```bash
terraform workspace select rishabh
```

## Using the Makefile

The Makefile provides a convenient way to run Terraform commands. Below are the available commands:

### Available Commands

- **Plan**: Runs `terraform plan` for a specified environment.
- **Apply**: Runs `terraform apply` for a specified environment.
- **Destroy**: Deletes the infrastructure for a specified environment.

### Running Makefile Commands

To run commands using the Makefile, specify the `ENV` variable to select the environment:

```bash
ENV=<workspace_name> make <command>
```

#### Example Commands

1. **Plan**: To see the changes that will be applied for the `rishabh` environment:

   ```bash
   ENV=rishabh make plan
   ```

2. **Apply**: To apply the changes for the `lakshay` environment:

   ```bash
   ENV=lakshay make apply
   ```

3. **Destroy**: To destroy the infrastructure for the `rishabh` environment:

   ```bash
   ENV=rishabh make destroy
   ```
